transclusion minor-minor mode

work in progress in progress.

basically a trimmed down version of [[https://github.com/gregdetre/emacs-freex][emacs-freex mode]]'s embedding mechanism

made primarily to work with org-mode files

what it's supposed to do

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results none
    (defun org-dblock-write:transclusion (params)
      (progn
        (with-temp-buffer
          (insert-file-contents (plist-get params :filename))
          (let ((range-start (or (plist-get params :min) (line-number-at-pos (point-min))))
                (range-end (or (plist-get params :max) (line-number-at-pos (point-max)))))
            (copy-region-as-kill (line-beginning-position range-start)
                                 (line-end-position range-end))))
        (yank)))
  #+END_SRC
  
  Then to include a line range from a given file, you can create a dynamic block like so:
  
  #+BEGIN: transclusion :filename "transclude.el" :min 2 :max 4
  #+END:
